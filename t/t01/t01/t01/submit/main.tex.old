Joe Cantcode wrote the following code to display the first
integer in the data segment 
to the
console.
But it doesn't work!!! Correct it.
In the code below, the first integer in the data segment is 2010.
But you cannot assume that it won't change in the future.
You must not change the data segment.

(From the management: This is a warm-up. Just insert one line.)

Tom Toofaz always jumps into his project assignments and hack out code ... and
ends up spending his night in the office.
He's having problem implementing the following requirement
in MIPS with less than four \verb!t!--registers.
But his manager, Sloe Arnn Steady, told him that four is \textit{way} too many.
Help Tom and he'll buy you lunch.

Write a code segment in MIPS to compute
\verb!9 * a - (b + c) + d! where
\verb!$s0!, \verb!$s1!, \verb!$s2!, and
\verb!$s3! have values of the C/C++ integer variables
\verb!a!, \verb!b!, \verb!c!, \verb!d! respective.
The result must be placed in \verb!$s4!.
Your code must be as efficient as possible
and you must use your registers efficiently too.
You may assume that the \verb!t!-registers
are not used elsewhere, and so you
can use the \verb!t!--registers in your code.
No such guarantee for the \verb!s!-registers -- therefore
you cannot change the values in
\verb!$s0!, \verb!$s1!, \verb!$s2!, and \verb!$s3!.
You also cannot use the \verb!a!-- and \verb!v!--registers.
Do not use the \verb!mul! or \verb!mult! command.
Write down the number of \verb!t!-registers used.

Your manager is fuming mad because there are bugs in the code

Your project leader Lee Pointa

(in ascending order)
on an

which will be used in a bubblesort that Bubba Short will use.
Lee says that the base address of the array is stored in \verb!$a0!
and the number of values in the array is stored in \verb!$a1!.
Another thing: Lee tells you he prefers you do not use an index variable, but
rather, use a pointer to iterate over the array.

Write a MIPS code fragment that, starting with $n$ (assume stored in
\verb!$s0!),
it
continually computes $3n + 1$ if $n$ is odd or $n/2$
if $n$ is odd
and store it back into $n$ until $n$ is $1$.
(\verb!/! is integer division.)
The values of $n$ are stores in an array in the data segment --
a label \verb!L! is already created for you (you don't have to create it).
For instance if the user
enters $3$, then the values are
\[
  3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
\]
For instance when $n = 3$, since $n$ is odd,
the next value of $n$ is $3n + 1 = 10$.
The next value for $n = 10$, since $n = 10$ is even,
is $n / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5$.
The values
\[
  3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
\]
are stored at the beginning of the data
segment.
Note that the starting value $n = 3$ is also stored.

Your boss just did a code review and found that Joe Cantcode
wrote some MIPS code implementing the following idea
in a critical part of the code to auto-correct
the tilt actuators on a high speed train:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
if (t0 == 0)
{
    t1 = 12;
}
else if (t0 == 1)
{
    t1 = 34;
}
else if (t0 == 2)
{
    t1 = 56;
}
else if (t0 == 3)
{
    t1 = 78;
}
\end{Verbatim}
where variables 
\verb!t0!,
\verb!t1!
are associated with registers
\verb!$t0!,
\verb!$t1!
respectively.
He has asked you rewrite the code to implement a switch 
in MIPS using the
jump table method 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
switch (t0)
{
    case 0:
        t1 = 12;
        break;
    case 1:
        t1 = 34;
        break;
    case 2:
        t1 = 56;
        break;
    case 3:
        t1 = 78;
}
\end{Verbatim}
so that he can do some 
performance analysis and see if the jump table method is faster.

        # At this point $t1 must be set to the right value based on your
        # implementation of switch

Just great.
Bubba Short is not back from lunch.
Lee Pointa said you have to write the bubblesort as a function  for him.
Remember that
the base address of the array is stored in \verb!$a0!
and the number of values in the array is stored in \verb!$a1!.
Just to be somewhat organized Lee told you to include at least
a \verb!swap! function that swaps the integer values at
addresses stored in \verb!$a0! and \verb!$a1!.
(You can add more functions if you like.
For instance you might want to have a function that performs
one pass of bubblesort.)
